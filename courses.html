                    <br>
                    <p>An introductory programming class, teaches the basics of C++ and either Matlab(101) or Python(183). Well taught class meant to ease into programming concepts and teach the basics used in later classes. If you have solid understanding of C++ or a similar language (Java) I would reccomend testing out of this. Very easy if you are familar with programming, otherwise could be more difficult if you have little knowledge</p>

                    <p>difficulty: moderate</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The first real programming class you will take. Covers concepts of object oriented programming, C++ fundamentals as well as basic data structures such as linked lists and trees. One of the most useful classes I've taken, bulk of learning comes from working with large complex projects. You will learn fundamental programming concepts used in every language, as well as debugging skills. Take this as soon as you can.</p>

                    <p>difficulty: moderate/heavy</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This class can be a true meat grinder if you aren't prepared or allot sufficient time to work on projects. Combines the scale of 280 projects with more complex problem solving methods. Just getting something to work is no longer good enough, now you must consdier the efficient way of accomplishing it. <br> Essential class for interviewing, covers everything you need to pass coding interviews. take this as soon as possible (freshman year or first sem sophomore year if possible)</p>

                    <p>workload: moderate</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> while this class certainly isn't easy, it is much less work than 281. Projects are fairly straightforward and easy compared to other classes, but biweekly homeworks and exams can be tricky. If you want to go into pure software this isn't particularly useful, but it is required, and is a prereq for eecs 482. Avoid taking with other project heavy classes if possible.

                    <p>difficulty: moderate/heavy</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> One of the best upper levels in my opinion, covers topics relevent to most non specialized jobs in the tech industry. Learn frontend and backend development required to make and scale an app, as well as backend frameworks like mapreduce and a search engine. Usefull class for internships, must take for SWE imo. <br>
                        Large group projects, can be time consuming so have a good group that you know you can work well with.

                    <p>difficulty: very heavy</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> One of the most difficult computer science upper levels you can take, but highly reccomended. You'll learn key concepts about multithreading and low level programming, as well as skills in debugging and working with a large codebase. Can be a good class for interviewing, especially for backend/netowrking positions and trading firms. Take with a light schedule if possible.

                    <br>
                    <p> Great class for learning on the job skills for software engineering. Covers testing, development practices, projects aim to mirror on the job scenarios with outdated libraries/dependencies, new unfamiliar languages. Not easy, but a lighter upper level that is useful for all types of SWE jobs.

                    <br>
                    <p> Take this class if you are interested in machine learning (obviously). Tackles more theoretical machine learning topics compared to EECS 492 or 442. Workload is moderate but can be challenging (think eecs 376), involving the mathematical proofs of a model rather than just pure coding.

                    <br>
                    <p>The EECS equivalent of this class. Covers front end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. One of the easier upper levels to take, especially if you have experience with front end development and languages. Usefull if you want to go into front end engineering.
