                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The software engineering field has seen explosive growth in recent years, and is one of the best career paths that
                        requires only a bachelor's degree (or even no degree). With top companies providing comfortable work life balance,
                        competitive salaries, and many opportunities for career growth, a career in software engineering is very appealing.
                        However, it can be a challenging industry to get into with a high barrier of entry, and a long and complex recruiting
                        process. In this guide I hope to give a step by step breakdown of how to crack into the industry in the simplest way
                        possible even if you aren’t a coding prodigy.

                    <h2>Step 1: Study</h2>
                    <p>
                        Learning to code is obviously essential for any career in software engineering or related tech fields. You can teach
                        yourself most of what you need to know to work in the field, but if you’re studying computer science there are many
                        classes that will help you in practical coding knowledge. An intro programming class and EECS 280 will teach you most of
                        what you need to know about programming fundamentals, most other classes are simply an application of this knowledge. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I
                        would recommend taking 280 then 281 as soon as possible, as these are the most beneficial classes for programming
                        understanding and interviewing. After this, classes like EECS 485 (web systems), EECS 483/SI339 (UI/UX), or EECS 482
                        (operating systems) will teach you other concepts like full stack development, different programming languages and
                        libraries, and concepts like multithreading. See my page on <a href="courses.html">courses</a> for more information on classes
                        I’d recommend.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "step">

                <div class = "text-wrap">
                    <h2>Step 2: Build personal projects</h2>
                    <p>In addition to classes, personal projects are a great opportunity to demonstrate your skills, especially if you do not
                    have prior internship experience. While some classes have good projects to add to your resume, many employers like to
                    see your initiative and creativity to make your own projects, so taking project based classes as well as creating your
                    own projects is an approach I’d recommend.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A good starting point is finding project tutorials that you can follow along
                        with or that provide information on ideas and libraries to use. After you complete these, move on to complete your own
                        ideas using the knowledge you learned from the walkthrough. This is an effective way to both learn and create projects
                        for your resume.

                    <h2>Step 3: Write a resume</h2>
                    <p>Once you have learned computer science fundamentals and put them to use in classes and personal projects, the next step
                    is to put it all together in a resume to show potential employers your skills in a concise document. I like 
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25u0eo/could_we_create_a_basic_undergrad_resume/">this template from reddit</a>
                    , which is similar to what I use on my own resume. Generally simple formatting is best, as it will perform
                    better in auto resume screening software that is frequently used.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I would recommend putting education at the top of the resume, and keep it fairly short with details on major, graduation
                        date, relevant classes taken, and GPA if it's above a 3.0.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Next I would put relevant experience next if you have any. This could be previous internships or relevant research or IA
                        work. I would put more detail into this section, as past experience is a major factor recruiters look for. Using action
                        words and numbers to describe and quantify impact will make this section stand out.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of if you have previous experience, the projects section allows you to showcase your ability to put your
                        skills to use, as well as your initiative to develop your skills in your own time. If you don’t have any previous
                        experience, this section can be great to demonstrate your ability to work on large complex projects in absence of actual
                        work experience.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, sections for skills and extracurriculars/leadership are good to round out your resume. List any programming
                    languages or common frameworks/libraries you are familiar with. An extracurricular/leadership section shows your ability
                    to work well in groups, regardless of if the activity is related to computer science or not.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Step 4: Prepare to interview</h2>
                    <p>Many top companies give coding interviews that require strong understanding of computer science fundamentals and data
                    structures and algorithms. EECS 281 will teach you everything you need to know for these interviews, so I would
                    recommend taking it as soon as possible. Regardless of if you have taken EECS 281, practicing for these types of
                    interviews is essential to getting into top software engineering companies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Leetcode has many commonly asked coding
                        interview questions, and lists like <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions">blind75</a>
                        or <a href="https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/">leetcode patterns</a> provide common questions in every major
                        category of coding question. Books like Elements of Coding Interviews and Cracking the Coding Interview also provide
                        comprehensive guides to common types of questions and how to solve them.

                    <h2>Step 5: Apply to jobs</h2>
                    <p>Most jobs for SWE internships and new grad jobs open in late July to August, altho many come out in following months.
                    One of the easiest ways to increase your chances of success is to apply early. Not only will you get a decision faster,
                    but interviews tend to be easier earlier in the season, and you don’t have to worry about positions filling up.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Early career jobs in software engineering is largely a numbers game, so the best strategy is to mass apply to all types
                        of companies, from FAANG+ to local tech companies. I’ve found for first internships, smaller local tech companies as
                        well as healthcare companies like UHG and Cigna tend to have higher success rates. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft
                        are among the easier FAANG+ companies, so I would highly recommend applying to these especially. Either way, applying to
                        100+ companies greatly increases your chances of success. Lists like <a href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships">this github page</a>
                        one have links to hundreds of available
                        internships.

                    <h2>Step 6: Interview tips</h2>
                    <p>Interviewing at tech companies tends to follow this general structure. First, an online coding assessment that can be
                    completed at any time. These are timed, and are assessed on completion and number of test cases passed, so I would
                    recommend using a language like python that is quick to code with if you are comfortable with it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Next is the main screening, the technical interview. Depending on the company and position, there can be anywhere from 1
                        to 5 rounds of these, although for internships, it tends to be 1-2 rounds, with one pure technical, and one final
                        interview with either behavioral elements or system design.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Use what you’ve learned in interview prep, and walk through your solution step by step. Being able to explain your logic
                        and communicate effectively is just as important as your ability to solve the problem. I tend to walk through an obvious
                        solution with poor time or space complexity to stall for time, then work towards the more efficient solution they are
                        looking for. This gives me more time to think and come up with an effective solution.

                    <h2>Step 7: Getting offers</h2>
                    <p>Assuming everything has gone well, you should end the recruiting season with at least one offer. If you only have one
                    offer, the decision is easy, otherwise there are several factors to consider when choosing somewhere to work. While pay
                    is appealing, the most important factors to consider is the ability to learn relevant skills, and the opportunities
                    provided by the company. Early in one’s career, gaining experience and learning is one one of the best investments to
                    make. Clout of the company is also something to consider, as having that company on your resume could open doors to top
                    companies. Regardless of what you pick, you are well on your way to beginning your career with an offer secured.</p>

                    you have the opportunity to learn a lot about the software engineering field and what it’s like to work for that
                    company. In addition, an internship serves as a 12 week long interview for the company to determine if you would be a
                    good fit as a full time employee. Making sure you meet your goals ensures that you get the most out of your experience
                    and maximize your chances of getting a return offer for another internship or a full time position.</p>
